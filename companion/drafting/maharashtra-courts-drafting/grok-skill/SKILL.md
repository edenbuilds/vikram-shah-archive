# Maharashtra Courts Drafting

Draft in the forum's own register. This skill is Maharashtra-only.

## Load first

Read as needed from this skill's `references/`:

- `territorial-jurisdiction.md` — district → Bombay bench / MAT / DRT
- `acronyms.md` — APL is not ABA; MAT is the Administrative Tribunal
- `court-fees-stamp.md`
- `efiling.md`

Full plugin lives at `/home/workdir/artifacts/maharashtra-courts-drafting/`.

When drafting a named instrument, load in this order:
1. `forum-config/exemplars/` for the bench or tribunal
2. `templates/` long-form official form (writ, reply affidavit, rejoinder, stay, MACT, consumer, DRT, deeds)
3. matching `skills/<case-type>-draft/SKILL.md` if it exists

Opposite-side drafts are first-class. A writ reply is `templates/high-court/affidavit-in-reply-writ.md`. A rejoinder is `templates/high-court/rejoinder-affidavit-writ.md`. Do not invent a short form when a long-form template exists.

## Pipeline

Reader (privacy firewall + fact ledger) → Format (forum header + skeleton) → Drafter → Verifier (no invented citations) → Refiner (strip model-voice) → Overseer (opposing-counsel notes) → filing-grade markdown / docx.

## House style — Bombay High Court

- `IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY.` at the Principal Seat.
- `IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY BENCH AT NAGPUR.` (or AURANGABAD / KOLHAPUR) at a bench.
- Appeals prefer `///VERSUS///`.
- Annexures `ANNEXURE-A`. A4, Times New Roman 14, 1.5, left margin ~4 cm.
- Court fees cite the Bombay Court-Fees Act, 1959. Deeds cite the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958.

## Routing

- State service matters → Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, not a writ in the first instance.
- Unfair labour practice / union recognition → Industrial Court under MRTU and PULP Act, 1971.
- IBC first instance → NCLT Mumbai, not the High Court.
- s.173 MV appeal follows the High Court bench of the MACT district.
- Kolhapur circuit districts — confirm the circuit is sitting; otherwise Principal Seat.

## Never

- Invent a reported citation, fee, or limitation article.
- Treat APL as anticipatory bail.
- File a Maharashtra district matter at the Goa Bench.
- Restore real identifiers until the final local render.
- Advertise legal services or guarantee Registry acceptance.

Every draft is a starting point for a practising advocate.
