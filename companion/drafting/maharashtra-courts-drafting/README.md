## Six-stage pipeline (mandatory)

1. **Reader** — ingest the case folder, build a fact ledger, apply the privacy firewall, halt if a required statute or order is missing.
2. **Format** — load the case-type skill + the forum-config for the chosen Bombay bench or tribunal.
3. **Drafter** — write Cause Title through List of Annexures in the forum's register.
4. **Verifier** — anti-hallucination pass against the fact ledger.
5. **Refiner** — apply verifier flags; strip model-voice; enforce paper, font, margin, annexure prefix.
6. **Overseer** — opposing-counsel read; emit `final-draft.docx` after local re-substitution.

Artifacts written, in order: `case-facts.md` → `format-shell.md` → `draft-v1.md` → `verification-report.md` → `draft-v2.md` → `opposing-notes.md` → `final-draft.docx`.

## Verification duty

AI drafts hallucinate section numbers, dates and annexure letters. The Verifier stage is not a substitute for the filing advocate. Read `DISCLAIMER.md` and `PRIVACY.md` before production use.
